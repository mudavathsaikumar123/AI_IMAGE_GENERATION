Configuration

Common Errors and Troubleshooting
API Key Invalid
Error message: "Failed to generate images. Make sure your API key is valid."
Solution: Double-check that you've entered your API key correctly in the script.js file.

CORS Issues
Error message: "Access to fetch at 'https://api.getimg.ai/...' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy."
Solution: You may need to run the application on a local server. You can use tools like Live Server extension in VSCode or Python's http.server module.

Image Loading Errors
Symptom: Images don't appear after generation.
Solution: Check the browser console for specific error messages. Ensure that the API is returning the expected data structure.

Rate Limiting
Error message: "Too Many Requests" or similar.
Solution: The getimg.ai API may have rate limits. Wait a few minutes before trying again, or check your API usage on your getimg.ai account.

JavaScript Errors
Symptom: The application doesn't respond when you click "Generate".
Solution: Check the browser console for JavaScript errors. Ensure all files (HTML, CSS, JS) are in the correct locations and properly linked.

Unsupported Browser
Symptom: The application doesn't work or looks incorrect.
Solution: Ensure you're using a modern, up-to-date web browser. Try a different browser if issues persist.
