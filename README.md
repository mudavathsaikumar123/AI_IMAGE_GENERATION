Common Errors and Troubleshooting

API Key Invalid

Error message: "Failed to generate images. Make sure your API key is valid." Solution: Double-check that you've entered your API key correctly in the script.js file. CORS Issues Error message: "Access to fetch at 'https://api.getimg.ai/...' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy." Solution: You may need to run the application on a local server. You can use tools like Live Server extension in VSCode or Python's http.server module. Image Loading Errors Symptom: Images don't appear after generation. Solution: Check the browser console for specific error messages. Ensure that the API is returning the expected data structure.

Rate Limiting

Error message: "Too Many Requests" or similar. Solution: The getimg.ai API may have rate limits. Wait a few minutes before trying again, or check your API usage on your getimg.ai account.

JavaScript Errors

Symptom: The application doesn't respond when you click "Generate". Solution: Check the browser console for JavaScript errors. Ensure all files (HTML, CSS, JS) are in the correct locations and properly linked. Unsupported Browser Symptom: The application doesn't work or looks incorrect. Solution: Ensure you're using a modern, up-to-date web browser. Try a different browser if issues persist.
